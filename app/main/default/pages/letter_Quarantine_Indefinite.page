<b>NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH QUARANTINE ORDER</b></div>
<br /><br />
The Larimer County Department of Public Health and Environment (LCDHE or “local health
department”) has determined that you recently have been in close contact with an individual who
has been presumptively lab-confirmed to have 2019 Novel Coronavirus disease, referred to in
this document as “COVID-19”. Based on this exposure, you have been identified as a person
with a high risk of contracting COVID- 19.
<br /><br />
Effective immediately, to protect the public’s health and to prevent further spread of the disease,
you are ordered to self-quarantine. Quarantine means separating an individual or group
reasonably believed to have been exposed to a communicable disease, but who is/are not yet ill,
from others who have not been exposed, to prevent the possible spread of the communicable
disease. You are further ordered to cooperate with LCDHE as indicated below:
<br /><br />
<b>Health Monitoring</b><br />
<ul>
<li>You shall cooperate with health care professionals in the administration of necessary infection
control actions and shall allow daily contact with LCDHE to assess whether you have developed
symptoms and may be infectious to others. If you need to seek medical care for any reason, you
must notify the healthcare provider that you are currently in quarantine due to an exposure to
COVID-19.</li></ul>
<b>Travel and Public Activities Restrictions</b>
<ul>
<li>You shall not travel by airplane, ship, long-distance bus, or train</li>
<li>Any other travel must be coordinated with and approved by public health</li>
<li>You shall separate yourself from others and avoid all public activities</li>
<li>You shall not use public transportation, such as light rail, bus, or taxi</li>
<li>You shall not go to school</li>
<li>Restrict visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home</li>
<li>You shall not go to work. Working from a home office is permitted</li>
<li>If you do not have respiratory symptoms, the public health agency may authorize limited outdoor activities (e.g. take a walk) as long as you maintain a minimum three-foot distance from any other individual.</li>
<li>Follow the terms of this Public Health Quarantine Order <b>until you are given a final release date from Larimer County Department of Health and Environment</b>. A negative test result <b>does not</b> release you from quarantine.</li>
</ul>    

<apex:image width="100%" url="{!$Resource.letterFooter}" /><br /><br /><br />
<ul>
<li>This is considered an ongoing exposure event as it takes place at a residence. Therefore, you must
continue to quarantine until you are given a final release date from local health authorities. This
may be a significantly longer period of time than if you quarantine elsewhere.</li>

<li>We strongly recommend that you find safer alternative accommodations that allow you to
quarantine without ongoing exposure to others. This may significantly reduce the length of
your quarantine order. Any alternative accommodations, as well as your transportation plan,
must be pre-approved in writing by LCDHE.</li>

<li>LCDHE is tasked with protecting the health and welfare of the citizens of Colorado by
investigating and controlling the causes of epidemic and communicable disease. This Public
Health Isolation Order is necessary to control any potential transmission of disease to others. §
25-1-506 (3) (b) (VI), Colorado Revised Statutes. Immediate issuance of this Order is necessary
for the preservation of public health, safety, or welfare, and observance of the requirements of the
Administrative Procedure Act would be contrary to the public interest.</li>
</ul>

<b>FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS ORDER IS SUBJECT TO THE PENALTIES
CONTAINED IN §25-1-514 and 25-1-516, COLORADO REVISED STATUTES,
INCLUDING A FINE OF UP TO FIVE THOUSAND (5,000) DOLLARS AND
IMPRISONMENT IN THE COUNTY JAIL FOR UP TO EIGHTEEN (18) MONTHS.</b>
